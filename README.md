* Once again, write a function that accepts a number and prints out a banner with the words "Challenge" and the number in it. Feel free to format it as you please, but don't copy and paste from the last one! **Call it before calling each function. Don't call it again if you need to print twice to test a function.**

* Write a function that prints out only the vowels from a given string. Do not use regular expressions ("regex").
* Now call it with "Regular expressions are for term 2.". You should see an "e" printed, followed by a "u", followed by an "a", and so on.

* Write a function that prints out the first 5 vowels from the given string. Continue to not use regexes.
* Now call it with "Regular expressions are for term 2.". You should see an "e" printed, followed by a "u", followed by an "a", followed by an "e", followed by another "e", and then nothing else.
* Now call it again with "Hello!" You should see only an "e" print.

* Write a function that prints out every third character, _without_ examining every character. In other words, you may _not_ increment your index by one and decide whether to print based on the result of a modulus operation on that index. (A standard solution for this.)
* Now call it with "I am the alfalfa and the omelette." You should see "a", followed by "t", followed by a space, and so on. An "e" should be the last thing printed, with no `undefined` values showing up.

* Write a function that prints out the first four characters in the string given from the index given forward, or, if there are fewer characters remaining from, prints only the remaining ones.
* Now call it with `'Oh hi, I didn't see you there. Welcome.'` and `4` as your parameters. You should see `'i'`, followed by `','`, followed by a space, followed by an '`I'`.
* Now call it again with `'Oh hi, I didn't see you there. Welcome.'` and `38` as your parameters. You should `'m'`, `'e'`, and `'.'` printed, and no fourth printing.

* Write a function that prints out the index of every `u` it finds in the given string. Do not use `indexOf`.
* Now call it with `'You picked the wrong house, bub.'`. You should see `2`, `23`, and `29` printed out. 

* Write a function that prints out the first index of the letter `u` in the given string. Do not use `indexOf`.
* Now call it with `'You picked the wrong house, bub.'` You should see the number `2` printed, and only that.

* Write a function that prints out the first index of the letter `u` in the given string, with a `-1` printed if it doesn't find it. Do not use `indexOf`.
* Now call it with `'You picked the wrong house, bub.'` You should see the number `2` printed, and only that.
* Now call it with `"I'm Canadian."` You should see `-1` print out.
